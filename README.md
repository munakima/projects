This repository contains a collection of my Python projects. Each project is a standalone application or script that demonstrates my Python coding skills and understanding of various Python libraries and frameworks.

## 📚 Projects

Here are the projects included in this repository:

### 🩺 [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)](./Breast_Cancer_Wisconsin_(Diagnostic))

This project is a machine learning model that predicts whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various features extracted from medical images of breast tissue. The model is trained on the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) using the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) machine learning library.

### 💰 [Medical Cost Estimation](./Medical_Cost_Estimation)

This project is a data analysis and visualization project that explores the [Medical Cost Personal Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance) on Kaggle. The project aims to answer questions like "What factors contribute to higher medical costs?" and "How does insurance coverage affect medical costs?" using Python data analysis and visualization libraries like [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

### 🫁 [Pneumonia Classification](./Pneumonia_Classification)

This project is a deep learning model that classifies chest X-ray images into normal and pneumonia cases. The model is trained on the [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) dataset using the [Keras](https://keras.io/) deep learning library.

Feel free to explore the code and learn more about these projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me.
