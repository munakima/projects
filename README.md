## üìö Projects

This repository contains a collection of my C# and Python projects.
Here are the projects included in this repository:

### :computer: C# Projects

This list shows a collection of my C# projects. Each project is a standalone application or script that demonstrates my Python coding skills and understanding of technologies and frameworks.

#### :ticket: [eTickets System](https://github.com/munakima/projects/tree/main/eTickets%20system)

eTickets is a web application that allows users to browse movies, book tickets and manage the database. It is built using the following technologies:
- EF Code First
- Repository Pattern
- Unit of Work Pattern
- Services Pattern
- Dependency Injection
- Unit Testing

### üêç Python Projects

This list shows a collection of my Python projects. Each project is a standalone application or script that demonstrates my Python coding skills and understanding of various Python libraries and frameworks.

#### :dna: [ProteinDB](./https://github.com/munakima/projects/tree/main/ProteinDB)

A Python system for cleaning up raw data and extracting information from 
[Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/docs/programmatic-access/file-download-services) and [AlphaFold Protein](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/download) Structure Databases. It will help predict protein folding, protein 3D structures and protein-protein interactions.


#### ü©∫ [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)](./Breast_Cancer_Wisconsin_(Diagnostic).ipynb)

This project is a machine learning model that predicts whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various features extracted from medical images of breast tissue. The model is trained on the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) using the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) machine learning library.

- Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- Data Cleaning and Exploration: Checking for missing values, Checking for duplicate data, Removing the "Unnamed" column, Converting "diagnosis" to category type, Removing outliers

After exploring the data, I found that removing outliers using Interquartile range (IQR) significantly improved the accuracy of the model. Using my get_outlier and get_outlier_by_weight functions, I was able to remove the outliers and achieve an accuracy of 1.0 with the RandomForestClassifier algorithm. 

#### üí∞ [Medical Cost Estimation](./Medical Cost Estimation.ipynb)

This project is a data analysis and visualization project that explores the [Medical Cost Personal Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance) on Kaggle. The project aims to answer questions like "What factors contribute to higher medical costs?" and "How does insurance coverage affect medical costs?" using Python data analysis and visualization libraries like [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

#### ü©∫ [Pneumonia Classification](./Pneumonia_Classification.ipynb)

This project is a deep learning model that classifies chest X-ray images into normal and pneumonia cases. The model is trained on the [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) dataset using the [Keras](https://keras.io/) deep learning library.

Feel free to explore the code and learn more about these projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me.
