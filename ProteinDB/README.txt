`PDBMeta.py` - Used to parse metadata associated with PDB file (resolution, organism source etc.)

The main aim of the file is to extract metadata from pdb files
we used three arguments to extract the metadata

the first argument is the name of the pdb file from which we want the meta data
Second argument is the meta data we want to extract from the pdb file
to find the resolution from a pdb file named 1fat.pdb:
simply type the following execution code in the terminal:
python PDBMeta.py 1fat.pdb resolution
