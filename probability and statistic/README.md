## <h1 id="top">ðŸ“š Python script</h1>

This Python script are implementations of probability and statistics concepts using Python and the SciPy library. 

### 1. [7 Real-Life Examples of the Binomial Distribution](./7_Real_Life_Examples_of_the_Binomial_Distribution.ipynb)

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real-Life Examples of the Binomial Distribution demonstrated with Python, SciPy library and Codewars test: 

> #### 1.Number of Side Effects from Medications
>
> #### 2.Number of Fraudulent Transactions
>
> #### 3.Number of Spam Emails per Day
>
> #### 4.Number of River Overflows
>
> #### 5.Shopping Returns per Week
>
> #### 6.Supporting the law
>
> #### 7.If a coin is tossed 5 times, using binomial distribution find the probability of (a) At least 4 heads.(b) At most 2 heads.


### 2. [Descriptive analysis](./Descriptive_analysis.ipynb)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Categorizing student grades into different bins.
> - Dividing the grades by 10 to get the tens digit.
> - Creating a list of categories for each tens digit (e.g. '10-19' for 10, '20-29' for 20, etc.).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calculated the measures of central tendency(mean, median, mode) and dispersion(Standard deviation, Variance, The range, The interquartile range) using the math library in Python. 

### 3. [Probability distribution](./Probability_distribution.ipynb)

> #### 1.The Uniform distribution and its example
> #### 2.The Normal Distribution
> #### 3.Bernoulli distribution
> #### 4.Binomial Distribution
> #### 5.Poisson Distribution
